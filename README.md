## Description
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management technique for students,
perfectionists and procastinators of all kinds. With a lack of terminal based
pomodoro timers, this project attempts to create a unique, intuitive 
yet feature filled pomodoro-timer which can run flawlessly in a bash terminal.
